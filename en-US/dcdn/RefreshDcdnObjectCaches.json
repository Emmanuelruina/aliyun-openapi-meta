You cannot delete the directory. If clients request resources after the resources on POPs are marked as expired, DCDN checks whether the resources on your origin server are updated with a later version. If a later version exists, DCDN retrieves the resources of the later version and returns the resources to the clients. Otherwise, DCDN retrieves the 304 status code from the origin server.",
